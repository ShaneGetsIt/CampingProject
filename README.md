# My first C++ Program
This is the first C++ programming project in ITCS-2530.
The program is a camping-packing assistant.
The program takes several user inputs regarding the user's upcoming trip.
The program then outputs the supplies they should bring based on the user's input. 
The program produces a menu which asks user to add an itinerary,
save and print to screen, or save only.


The following instructions are in the order you can expect them to be relevant:

For your name, the program will receive up to a 25 character string as input.
The subsequent 3 user inputs ask for an integer value, but will only display
up to 2 digits - please bear this in mind.

If you wish to add extra items to the supply list, enter Y or y when prompted.
You will be asked to enter '1' for food, '2' for gear and '3' when finished.
The extra items prompt takes string inputs, but will only print out to 21 characters.
You must enter each additional item one at a time; when you are done entering
additional items, enter "3".

Once the user's information has been collected, the menu will be displayed;
User will be asked to either create(an)/replace(the existing) itinerary,
save the report AND display it on the console or save the file only.
Simply enter 1,2 or 3. Thanks for reading!
